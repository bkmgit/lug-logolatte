# Steps in recreating the Nairobi LUG

* There is a hidden bezier line that puts the Nairobi LUG on path around the mug
* Gotta find a way to make that line's opacity to 100%, otherwise you don't get to edit it properly
* Better have the fonts: Open sans, Merriweather and Cabin Sketch
* Better have Inkscape running on GNU/Linux when you open the SVG

#New logo; Glow on GNU, gnu on.
Use *logo.svg* then select the veritable GNU. Go to Filters > Color > Soft colors | Solarize
The green for CSS = 94c52a, b5c94a
The purple for CSS = Forgot how to pick properly with GIMP. kept getting a dark version...
